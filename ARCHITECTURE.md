  Suggested Architecture Diagram:
  This repository structure represents a simple web application with a frontend and backend component.
  The frontend is composed of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, while the backend is managed by a CI/CD pipeline defined in ci-cd.yml.
  The architecture is designed to be scalable and maintainable, with a clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend components.
